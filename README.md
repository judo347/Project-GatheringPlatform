# Project: Gathering Platform [WIP]

Welcome to Gathering Platform - a platformer about gathering resources and using it to purchase player abilities, level modifiers and more!

The gameloop is as following; You spawn in at a local tavern. Here you have several options, which is explained below, but eventuality you will enter the portal and the journey of gathering resources has started. You then run, jump and glide through a level collecting resources and one way or the other end up back at the tavern. Here you spend the collected resources and then enter a now more difficult and rewarding level. The game currently contains no final win condition.

## Tavern

The tavern is your home. It is where you start and where you end up after finishing a level. The tavern provides benches used to upgrade [todo], several characters to choose from, and a portal which leads to the Level where resources is collected.

### Benches

Benches are where you convert the gathered resources into skill points and where skill points are spend. These can be used to purchase upgrades which changes the level or gives the character additional abilities.

The *Converter* bench, is used to convert gathered resources into skill points, which can be spend on upgrades at the other benches.

The *Unique Ability* bench, is used to unlock perks which changes the gameplay. This is *No Death Penalty*, which prevents lose of resources on death, and the *Flip World* ability, which flips the level upside-down and thereby reversing gravity.

The *Level Modification* bench, is used to add/increased modifiers to the level. These modifiers are: danger, material yield and player movement speed. Spending skill points on these will modify and ultimately increase the resource yield of the level.

The *Character Modification* bench, is used to unlock and give the player new abilities, such as: double jump and slide.

### Characters

The game contains three characters to freely choose from. You can change to any of them in the tavern. They currently have no differences, but this will be implemented in the future. [TODO is this true?]
