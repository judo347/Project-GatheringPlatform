# Project: Gathering Platform [WIP]

Welcome to Gathering Platform - a platformer about gathering resources and using it to purchase player abilities, level modifiers and more!

The gameloop is as following; You spawn in at a local tavern. Here you have several options, which is explained below, but eventuality you will enter the portal and the journey of gathering resources has started. You then run, jump and glide through a level collecting resources and one way or the other end up back at the tavern. Here you spend the collected resources and then enter a now more difficult and rewarding level. The game currently contains no final win condition.

## Tavern

The tavern is your home. It is where you start and where you end up after finishing a level. The tavern provides benches used to upgrade [todo], several characters to choose from, and a portal which leads to the Level where resources is collected.
